# WebQuills: A Multi-site, Multi-user Publishing System

The WebQuills publishing system allows multiple users to publish websites while
maximizing efficiency of production and delivery. An individual user can manage multiple
websites, and can invite other users to participate in site production.

The sites produced by WebQuills are intended to be lightweight, energy efficient,
bandwidth efficient, and inexpensive to operate. Most site pages are generated at
production time and served statically via CDN, improving performance and reducing server
costs over traditional dynamic site delivery.

## Features

- Blog-style site organization
- For SEO, articles are URL-mapped by section (topic) rather than by date.
- RSS Feeds are provided for the site and each section.
- Sitemaps are automatically generated.
- Pages include OpenGraph and Schema.org metadata for improved SEO and social sharing.
