## Attribution

If you are running a web site, especially in any kind of professional capacity,
you need to care about copyright. Despite the fact that nearly every
professional publishing operation publishes content acquired from third parties,
most content management systems completely ignore the need to track copyright
and license information for third party content. In fact, they tend to ignore
the possibility that thrid party content might be added to the system at all.
This can get you into legal hot water in common situations like using
third-party images on your website.

WebQuills deals with these issues through its Attribution system. An Attribution
is a snippet of text associated with a content item, intended to be displayed on
the site to give credit. Each Attribution can be associated with a bundle of
copyright information which allows you to track the copyright owner and the
license under which you used the content. If an owner ever revokes their license
or sends a DMCA take-down notice, you have a way of tracking down the content in
question, finding evidence of the license, and bulk-removing the content if
necessary.

Attributions can be applied to all content items: articles, images, documents,
etc. You can also create a default Attribution for a site to be applied to all
items lacking specific attribution.

An Attribution can also be associated with a WebQuills user. This is useful in
cases where multiple users publish under the same psuedonym, or a single user
publishes under multiple psuedonyms, allowing you to keep track internally of
who created what.

### Use cases for Attributions

- Byline displayed on site is different from user name (or includes additional
  info, like a hyperink)
- Multiple users publish under the same byline, but we want to track who created
  what.
- One user publishes under multiple Bylines.
- Content is included under a Creative Commons license or other license that
  requires attribution.
- Content is syndicated from a thrid party source and requires "link back" or
  other attribution.
- A syndication agreement ends, requiring you to find and remove all content
  from a syndication partner.
